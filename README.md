### Let's practice some terminal commands to get the code on our computers
* From the terminal, create a folder called `NashWD-1D`
* Then, use the command `touch` to create an index.html and style.css file
* Go to the GitHub [page](https://github.com/codebug-us/NashWD-1D), and click on the link to the `index.html` file at the top. Then click `Raw`, and copy/paste that code into the index.html file you created on your computer. 
* Do the same thing for `style.css`	
* Look at all of the code in your copy of `index.html` and `style.css`
* DO NOT change any code in `index.html`
* Fix the code in `style.css` so that it is working properly
  * HINT: the code in `style.css` is mostly correct, but we are accessing the ids and classes incorrectly
* After fixing your cheeseburger, please answer the questions at the bottom of style.css


##### If you finish early...
* Change the color of the text to yellow
* Add more HTML and style it in the CSS to add more toppings to your cheeseburger. Here's a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato:
